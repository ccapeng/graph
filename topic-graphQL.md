# GraphQL


- [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/) 

	- A query language(QL) for your API.
	
	- Get many resources in a single request.
	
	- Is this really graph theory related?
		- That is really depended on how you interpret :
			"A request determines the shape of its data response, and a data response can be used to easily construct its suitable request."

	- GraphQL vs REST
