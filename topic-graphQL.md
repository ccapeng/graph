# GraphQL


- [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/) 

	- A query language(QL) for your API.
	
	- Get many resources in a single request.
	
	- Is this really graph theory related?
		- That is really depended on how you interpret :
			"A request determines the shape of its data response, and a data response can be used to easily construct its suitable request."
			Quote from [Quora](https://www.quora.com/What-is-GraphQL?share=1)
			
	- GraphQL vs REST
	
		- REST :
		
			- Get a data with full object.
			
			- In general, the url end point is mapping to one database table.
			
		- GraphQL :
			- Get a data with only necessary fields base on your definition.  
				Data can be smaller.
			- Get data in one request for cross database tables.
